# 🏛️ CertifyHub: Digital Document Certification Platform

## 🌟 Project Overview
CertifyHub is a digital transformation solution aimed at modernizing the process of certifying official documents (IDs, Proof of Residence, Academic Certificates). By moving the initial submission, verification, and review process online, we eliminate the need for citizens to queue for hours at public service points. The platform uses AI and a robust biometric verification pipeline to ensure security and authenticity.

The final, legally certified document can then be either issued digitally or made available for quick, scheduled physical collection at an authorized public service point (e.g., Police Station or Post Office), completing the digital transformation cycle.

## ✨ Key Features (MVP)

The user journey is simple, secure, and fast in 5 core steps:

1.  **Secure Document Upload:** Users select the document type (ID, Proof of Resident, Academic Certificate, etc.) and upload scans.
2.  **Biometric Verification:** Authentication via Facial Recognition or Fingerprint Scan to verify the user's identity against the uploaded ID document.
3.  **AI Document Check:** Automated AI analysis for document authenticity, tampering detection, and standard compliance.
4.  **Admin Review Queue:** Authorized personnel review the AI results and officially approve or decline the certification.
5.  **Digital Certificate Issuance:** Users can track their certification status, view the certified document, and initiate a download or physical collection.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

CertifyHub is built on a modern, scalable, and fully managed cloud infrastructure:

* **Frontend:** **React** & **Next.js** (For server-side rendering, performance, and robust routing).
* **Backend & Database:** **Firebase** (Firestore for NoSQL database, Cloud Functions for serverless logic, and Authentication for user management).
* **Hosting:** Vercel / Firebase Hosting.
* **UI/UX:** Focus on a clean, professional, and accessible user interface (as sketched in wireframes).
